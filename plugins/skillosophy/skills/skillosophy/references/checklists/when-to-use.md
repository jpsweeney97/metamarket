# When to Use Checklist

## Structural
- [MUST] Section exists with clear heading or equivalent
- [MUST] Contains activation triggers (when this skill applies)

## Semantic
- [MUST] Primary goal stated in 1-2 sentences
- [MUST] Triggers are specific enough to avoid over-broad activation
- [SHOULD] Includes example scenarios or user phrases that trigger activation

## Anti-patterns
- [SEMANTIC] Vague triggers: "when you need to do X" without specifics
- [SEMANTIC] Overlapping scope with other skills without differentiation
